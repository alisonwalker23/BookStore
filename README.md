# BookStore - (Bookhive Corp.) 
 
Bookhive Corp. is a leading publishing house in the US. The company headquarters is located in 
Atlanta. It has been publishing books, articles, journals, novels, magazines, and encyclopedias 
for the past fifteen years. The customers of the company include students, IT professionals, and 
research scholars. The company enjoys a dominant position in the publishing business with 15 
retail stores in all major cities in US. 
  
Presently, the company depends on the print and electronic media to advertise its books. There 
is a static website that is periodically updated whenever a new book is released. Many 
competitors of the company already have their e-commerce stores and are selling books online. 
Bookhive is losing its customers to competitors because people prefer buying books online, 
without having to visit a retail store. Customers often complain that due to an inadequate 
number of stores in their city, they have to travel a long distance to reach a store. In addition, 
customers visiting a store complain that, at times, the books that they are looking for are not 
available in the stores. 
Hence, many orders remain unplaced and customers are dissatisfied. As a result, there has 
been a loss in the company's revenue. 
   
 
## The Proposed System 
It is evident that the existing business model is insufficient to meet customer demands. 
To address the current limitations, the management has tied up with a software development 
organization. The management has instructed the organization to create an online bookstore 
application that can be globally used to order books. In the first phase, the Bookhive application 
will simplify the process of managing stocks and enable the organization to sell books online. 
The application should provide a consistent mechanism to enable customers to buy books 
online and administrators to manage book stocks online. Currently, the management wants 
that all orders should be processed at a centralized location and delivered through the relevant 
store. Later, each store will have its own interface through which it will be able to manage the 
orders pertaining to that store. 
To provide the envisioned functionalities, the Bookhive application should have the following 
features during
